# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-Duration

The main questions the project revolves around:

    Has Netflix movie duration decreased over time?
    If so, what could be the possible reason?
    How does genre diversity affect movie duration?

It turned out that lately, Netflix has released significantly more documentaries, stand-ups, and children movies, which all tend to be shorter. Therefore, this could likely affect the movie duration when looking at the whole dataset. But, this was just a quick exploratory data analysis, and one should explore further before concluding that is the case. At the very least, the findings from this project provided a solid base for further analysis, looking to collect additional data and, of course, asking more related questions.

This project is available on DataCamp's platform. 

Some of the things I did in the project:
    Read a .csv file into a dataframe.
    Visualise data through line plots and scatter plots with Matplotlib.
    Filtered rows using logic operators.
